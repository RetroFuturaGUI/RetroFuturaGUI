# RetroFuturaGUI

RetroFuturaGUI is a signal-slot-based GUI framework written in C++. It is designed to maximize flexibility across multiple platforms. By compiling the framework's logic into a dynamic library, it is possible to use the framework with other languages, too. Last but not least, RetroFuturaGUI brings back many aesthetics of the past, as well as the present and future; hence its name.
